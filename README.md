A simple, local-only kanban board to track your projects' progress.

### Why?

I like to use very simple [kanban boards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) to organise my work on small side projects. There's a plethora of platforms offering a myriad of configurations for online kanban boards – all of which are way more complicated than what I need. These services also generally want to sell you subscriptions or extra features for a price, which I don't want. Additionally, they all require you to sign up (with a few exceptions) and confirm your email to use their service. In short, it's a hassle.

I figured I could whip something together quickly to not be hassled anymore, so I did.

### Features

- Simple: Only 3 columns – backlog, in progress, done;
- More than one project: You can create as many boards as you need;
- Easy: No signup (or internet connection) required;
- Private: Your data never leaves your computer.

### Run it yourself

```
$ npm run dev
```
